                  Example Handshake Traces for TLS 1.3
                 draft-thomson-tls-tls13-vectors-latest

Abstract

   Examples of TLS 1.3 handshakes are shown.  Private keys and inputs
   are provided so that these handshakes might be reproduced.
   Intermediate values, including secrets, traffic keys and ivs are
   shown so that implementations might be checked incrementally against
   these values.

1.  Introduction

   TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] defines a new key schedule and a number
   new cryptographic operations.  This document includes sample
   handshakes that show all intermediate values.  This allows an
   implementation to be verified incrementally, examining inputs and
   outputs of each cryptographic computation independently.

   Private keys are included with the traces so that implementations can
   be checked by importing these values and verifying that the same
   outputs are produced.

   Note:  This version of the document shows vectors from version -16 of
      the draft.  It will be updated when NSS is updated to -18 (real
      soon now).

2.  Private Keys

   Ephemeral private keys are shown as they are generated in the traces.

   The server in most examples uses an RSA certificate with a private
   key of:

   modulus (public):  b4bb498f8279303d 980836399b36c698 8c0c68de55e1bdb8

3.  Simple 1-RTT Handshake

   In this example, the simplest possible handshake is completed.  The
   server is authenticated, but the client remains anonymous.  After
   connecting, a few application data octets are exchanged.  The server
   sends a session ticket that permits the use of 0-RTT in any resumed
   session.

   Note:  This example doesn't include the calculation of the exporter
      secret.  Support for that will be added to NSS soon.

4.  Resumed 0-RTT Handshake

   This handshake resumes from the handshake in Section 3.  Since the
   server provided a session ticket that permitted 0-RTT, and the client
   is configured for 0-RTT, the client is able to send 0-RTT data.

5.  Security Considerations

   It probably isn't a good idea to use the private key here.  If it
   weren't for the fact that it is too small to provide any meaningful
   security, it is now very well known.
